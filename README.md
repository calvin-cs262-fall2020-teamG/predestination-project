### Vision Statement

For centuries, men and women have embarked on journeys to find treasure. Nowadays, many organizations seek to replicate the process of treasure hunting as a game to promote team bonding and problem-solving skills. One impact of these games is that the players and hosts do not always clean up after themselves, leaving trash and other debris behind.

As good stewards of the Earth, we are called to leave nothing behind except footprints. Our app, Predestination, is for Calvin student organizations who wish to host treasure hunts, whether to bring people together and have fun—socially distanced of course—or to familiarize students with the campus. Our app allows hosts, called “admins,” to pin riddles on the virtual map. When players, called “seekers,” approach them at the physical location, the app will reveal the virtual note, displaying the riddle that guides the seekers to the next destination. Unlike traditional treasure hunts, Predestination conducts the clues and the game virtually, preventing any garbage to be left behind. Predestination combines technological ingenuity with an age-old game to deliver a fun, modern spin in this time of need for environmental care.
