# CS 262 - Team G - Predestination

### Vision Statement

For centuries, men and women have embarked on journeys to find treasure. Many organizations seek to replicate the process of treasure hunting as a game to promote team bonding and problem-solving skills. In an effort to orchestrate such adventures, Keepers—those who hide the treasure—use a variety of materials to guide their hunters: plastic signs, paper signs, and other signs. As a result, one impact of these games is that the players and hosts do not always clean up after themselves, leaving trash and other debris behind. As good stewards of the Earth, we are called to leave nothing but footprints. 

Unlike traditional treasure hunts, our mobile app *Predestination* conducts the clues and the game virtually, preventing any garbage to be left behind. With *Predestination*, there’s no need to carry around a laptop or a box full of materials. Not only does our app discourage and prevent pollution, but it also reduces digital waste such as storage space and battery consumption. *Predestination* runs on two major platforms: Android and iOS. It is a game for Calvin faculty and students—but primarily student organizations—who wish to host treasure hunts. The app familiarizes students with the campus and brings people together to have fun, all socially distanced of course. With the flexibility of *Predestination*, not only do Keepers host a game, but they lead a fun exercise and provide a way to meet new people. Our app allows Keepers to pin riddles on the virtual map, which, when visited by the players called “Seekers,” will notify and reveal the next clue in the treasure hunt. *Predestination* combines technological ingenuity with an age-old game to deliver a fun, modern spin in this time of need for environmental care and social bonding in a socially distanced world, leaving nothing behind except ephemeral footprints.
