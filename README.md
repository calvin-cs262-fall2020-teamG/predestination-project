### Vision Statement

For centuries, men and women have embarked on journeys to find treasure. Nowadays, many organizations seek to replicate the process of treasure hunting as a game to promote team bonding and problem-solving skills. In an effort to orchestrate this adventure, those who “plant” the treasure use a variety of materials to guide their hunters: plastic signs, paper signs, and other signs. Furthermore, players sometimes use physical objects to mark where they’ve been. As a result, one impact of these games is that the players and hosts do not always clean up after themselves, leaving trash and other debris behind. As good stewards of the Earth, we are called to leave nothing behind except footprints. 

With our mobile app, Predestination, there’s no need to carry around a laptop or a gigantic box full of materials. Not only does our app discourage and prevent physical waste, but it also reduces digital waste including, but not limited to, storage space and battery consumption. Predestination runs on two major platforms: Android and iOS. It is a game for Calvin faculty and students—but primarily student organizations—who wish to host treasure hunts. Predestination familiarizes students with the campus and brings people together to have fun, all socially distanced of course. Our app allows hosts, called “Keepers,” to pin riddles on the virtual map. When players, called “Seekers,” approach them at the physical location pinned on the map, the app will reveal the virtual note, displaying the riddle that guides the seekers to the next destination. Unlike traditional treasure hunts, Predestination conducts the clues and the game virtually, preventing any garbage to be left behind. Predestination combines technological ingenuity with an age-old game to deliver a fun, modern spin in this time of need for environmental care and social bonding in a socially distanced world. So come, join us on this adventure, leaving nothing but ephemeral footprints behind.
